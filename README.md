- YOLOv5 (Object Detection)
- Raspberry Pi
- MQTT Protocol
- AWS IoT Core
- AWS Lambda
- AWS SNS
- Linux

## 🧠 System Architecture
1. Camera captures live road footage
2. YOLOv5 processes frames and detects animals
3. Detection data sent via MQTT
4. AWS IoT Core triggers AWS Lambda
5. AWS SNS sends real-time alerts

## 🏆 Achievements
- National recognition for innovation and real-world impact
- Successful integration of AI, IoT, and cloud technologies
- Designed for scalable, real-time deployment
